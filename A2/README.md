# A2 Submission – Use Case

## A2a: About the groups

Most groups are relatively new to python coding and GitHub with a few members having more experience.

---

## A2b: Identity Claim

Complete set of scripts will be able to check the following claim:

- **Claim:** For a given building, are structural elements: Beams and collumns, made according to Eurocode requirements? What is the structural capacity of the members and is it sufficient for subjected loading?

---

## A2c: Use Case

The claim will be checked by using the multitude of scripts developed by the analyst groups. The scripts will all serve the purpose of analyzing different structural members to then get an overview of the total statics of the building.

The claim relies on information regarding **Dimensions** and **Material** properties, which heavily depends on *gathering* data from the IFC-model using *ifcopenshell*.

The program can be used to check claims mainly in the preliminary design phase regarding **design**.  

---

## A2d: Scope the Use Case

The analyst groups have made scripts that can determine dimensions of structural members **Beams** and **Collumns** and how they comply with Eurocode requirements for beams, collumns and walls.

---

## A2e: Tool Idea

Using the tools from each analyst group, a complete program/tool will be able to verify the load bearing capacity of elements in a given building using data collected via. ifcopenshell.

The program checks structural members **Beams** and **Collumns** for their capacity and compliance with Eurocode requirements. 

---

## A2f: Information Requirements

The program mainly uses geometric information. Dimensions of beams, slabs and columns must be collected, in order to determine compliance with the eurocode and to calculate capacities of elements. 

---

## A2g: Identify Appropriate Software License

GPL-3.0 has been chosen in this course as suitable licensing.
